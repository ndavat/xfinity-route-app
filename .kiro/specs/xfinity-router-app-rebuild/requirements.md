# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for building the Home Router Master app from scratch. The new application will be a modern, cross-platform mobile app built with React Native and Expo, designed to provide comprehensive router management capabilities with improved user experience, better architecture, and enhanced reliability.

The app will enable users to connect to their Xfinity routers, monitor connected devices, control network access, and manage router settings through an intuitive mobile interface. The rebuild focuses on creating a scalable, maintainable codebase with proper separation of concerns, robust error handling, and comprehensive testing.

2. WHEN displaying devices THEN the system SHALL show MAC address, IP address, hostname, connection type, and signal strength
3. WHEN a device connects or disconnects THEN the system SHALL update the device list in real-time
4. WHEN device data is unavailable THEN the system SHALL handle missing information gracefully with appropriate fallbacks
5. WHEN the device list is large THEN the system SHALL implement efficient scrolling and search functionality
6. WHEN displaying device status THEN the system SHALL clearly indicate online/offline status with visual indicators

### Requirement 3: Device Access Control

**User Story:** As a parent or network administrator, I want to block or unblock specific devices so that I can control internet access for family members or unauthorized devices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user selects a device THEN the system SHALL provide options to block or unblock the device
2. WHEN blocking a device THEN the system SHALL immediately apply the restriction and confirm the action
3. WHEN unblocking a device THEN the system SHALL restore internet access and provide confirmation
4. WHEN a block/unblock operation fails THEN the system SHALL retry automatically and show error details if unsuccessful
5. WHEN managing device access THEN the system SHALL maintain a history of access control changes
6. WHEN applying restrictions THEN the system SHALL provide estimated time for changes to take effect

### Requirement 4: Device Management and Customization

**User Story:** As a network administrator, I want to customize device names and manage device information so that I can easily identify and organize my network devices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user views a device THEN the system SHALL allow editing of custom device names
2. WHEN a custom name is set THEN the system SHALL persist the name locally and display it consistently
3. WHEN managing devices THEN the system SHALL allow adding comments or notes for each device
4. WHEN viewing device details THEN the system SHALL show comprehensive network information including IPv6, DHCP type, and signal strength
5. WHEN organizing devices THEN the system SHALL provide filtering and sorting options by connection type, status, and custom criteria
6. WHEN device information changes THEN the system SHALL update the display automatically

### Requirement 5: Router Information and Status

**User Story:** As a network administrator, I want to view router status and system information so that I can monitor network health and troubleshoot issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the app connects to the router THEN the system SHALL display router status, uptime, and firmware information
2. WHEN showing router information THEN the system SHALL include connected device count, WiFi SSID, and internet connection status
3. WHEN router status changes THEN the system SHALL update the information automatically
4. WHEN system information is unavailable THEN the system SHALL show appropriate fallback values
5. WHEN displaying network health THEN the system SHALL provide visual indicators for connection quality
6. WHEN monitoring router performance THEN the system SHALL track and display key metrics

### Requirement 6: Router Control Operations

**User Story:** As a network administrator, I want to restart my router remotely so that I can resolve connectivity issues without physical access to the device.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user initiates router restart THEN the system SHALL require confirmation before proceeding
2. WHEN restart is confirmed THEN the system SHALL send the restart command and provide status updates
3. WHEN restart is in progress THEN the system SHALL show estimated downtime and progress indicators
4. WHEN restart fails THEN the system SHALL provide error details and retry options
5. WHEN restart completes THEN the system SHALL automatically reconnect and verify router status
6. WHEN restart is not supported THEN the system SHALL clearly indicate the limitation

### Requirement 7: Application Settings and Configuration

**User Story:** As a user, I want to configure app settings and router credentials so that I can customize the app behavior and manage multiple router configurations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses settings THEN the system SHALL provide options to configure router IP, username, and password
2. WHEN saving router credentials THEN the system SHALL store them securely using encrypted storage
3. WHEN managing app preferences THEN the system SHALL allow toggling between mock and live modes for testing
4. WHEN configuring network settings THEN the system SHALL validate input and provide helpful error messages
5. WHEN switching configurations THEN the system SHALL apply changes immediately and reconnect if necessary
6. WHEN resetting settings THEN the system SHALL provide confirmation and restore default values

### Requirement 8: Error Handling and User Feedback

**User Story:** As a user, I want clear error messages and helpful guidance so that I can resolve issues and understand what's happening with my network connection.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an error occurs THEN the system SHALL display user-friendly error messages with specific details
2. WHEN network issues arise THEN the system SHALL provide troubleshooting steps and connection advice
3. WHEN operations succeed THEN the system SHALL show confirmation messages with relevant details
4. WHEN the app is loading THEN the system SHALL display progress indicators and status updates
5. WHEN connectivity is lost THEN the system SHALL detect the issue and guide the user through reconnection
6. WHEN errors persist THEN the system SHALL offer advanced diagnostics and support options

### Requirement 9: Performance and Reliability

**User Story:** As a user, I want the app to be fast and reliable so that I can efficiently manage my network without delays or crashes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the app starts THEN the system SHALL initialize within 3 seconds on modern devices
2. WHEN fetching device data THEN the system SHALL complete requests within 5 seconds or show timeout handling
3. WHEN navigating between screens THEN the system SHALL provide smooth transitions without lag
