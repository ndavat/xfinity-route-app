## ðŸ¤” FAQ (Addressed in Video)

**Q: Do I need to install Android Studio for iOS development?**
A: No, but it's recommended for testing on Android emulators.

**Q: Can I contribute without running E2E tests locally?**
A: Yes, our CI pipeline runs E2E tests, but local testing is encouraged.

**Q: What's the difference between MCP tests and unit tests?**
A: MCP tests are behavior-driven and test user scenarios, while unit tests focus on individual components.

**Q: How do I handle React Native module compatibility issues?**
A: Check the troubleshooting section in README.md or watch the demo's troubleshooting segment.
